Overview
SecureLife Insurance Co. needs a predictive model to estimate insurance premium amounts. This project involves end-to-end model development, including data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🎯 Objective
Clean and preprocess the dataset

Explore features and relationships

Build and evaluate regression models

Interpret results and provide insights

📁 About the Dataset
Records: 200,000+

Features: 20 (categorical, numerical, textual)

Target: Premium Amount

Challenges include missing values, skewed data, and formatting issues.

Key Features:
Age, Gender, Income, Marital Status

Health Score, Credit Score, Vehicle Age

Smoking Status, Exercise Frequency

Policy Type, Claims History, Location

Policy Start Date, Customer Feedback

🧠 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, fix data types, and normalize skewed features.

2. EDA:
Univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis to find trends.

3. Feature Engineering:
Encode categorical variables and extract new features.

4. Model Building:
Train-test split and regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost).

5. Optimization:
Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation using MAE, MSE, R².

🛠️ Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook

✅ Status
Model built and evaluated. Further optimization and deployment can be explored.
